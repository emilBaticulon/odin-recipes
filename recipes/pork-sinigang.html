    <h2>Filipino soup cooked with pork</h2>
    <p>Serve with rice and for additional sauce, use soy or fish sauce. If you want to, you can add what Filipinos call gabi gabi, which is a small taro root. When peeled they look like potatoes. You can add 5 to 6 of them when you add the water and make sure they are cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked because they can get too soft.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, chopped</li>
        <li>2 plum tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
        <li>1 pound bone-in pork chops</li>
        <li>4 cups water, more if needed</li>
        <li>1 (1.41 ounce) package tamarind soup base (such as Knorr®)</li>
        <li>½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with salt. Stir in the ginger, tomatoes, and pork chops. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Turn the pork occasionally, until browned. Pour in the water and tamarind soup base. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat. Continue simmering until the pork is tender and cooked through, about 30 minutes. Stir in green beans and cook until tender.
