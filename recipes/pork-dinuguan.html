    <h2>Filipino Pork Dinuguan</h2>
    <p>Definitely a dish for the more adventurous crowd, dinuguan is also referred to as chocolate meat due to its dark brown hues. But don't be fooled - this dish is anything but sweet! In fact, this savory stew consists of what may be the farthest thing from chocolate. Warm, hearty, and filling, dinuguan is popular (or notorious?) for its main ingredient: pork blood. Add in some bay leaves, onions, ginger, garlic, and long green pepper, and you have yourself a delicious stew! How to cook dinuguan, as well as all its strong flavors, is a recipe that we have passed down for years.</p>
